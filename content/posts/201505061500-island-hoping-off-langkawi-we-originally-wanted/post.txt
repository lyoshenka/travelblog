Text: We originally wanted to go snorkling, but the prime snorkling (Langkawi Coral) was a long boat ride away, and this deal was much more convieniant and reasonable. It was a half day boat ride through the islands with 3 stops: Island of the pregnant lady, watching Eagle feeding, and Beras Basah Island.
