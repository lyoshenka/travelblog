Text: (and reflections on week 1)

Last night was my first night on&nbsp;“casualty.” Essentially, my team is the one acting as the emergency room and we can admit up to 70-80 patients in a night.&nbsp;

While in my first few days I couldn’t help but focus on the difference in conditions from the US, in reality care is really much the same. They just have to be incredibly efficient and are more conscious of cost and allocating resources by focusing more on physical exam and utilizing every result on a panel they order instead of ordering more tests. In reality most of that is actually quite impressive. The registrars say that’s why doctors want to work in Colombo. The “periphery” is beautiful but it is much more frustrating to try and provide the level of care the patients need without all the resources.

Last night I found myself helping to push a stretcher as we all ran across the huge medical complex over bumpy concrete toward the “surgical theater” and stopping midway while they intubated the patient at around 2am. For me it was neat to see the team band together in the face of stress.

I haven’t had a chance to explore the whole complex yet but it’s an interesting mix of beautiful old colonial buildings (literally built way back by the British) and a few modern buildings amid many piles of rubbish and areas of construction.&nbsp;I look forward to exploring more of the hospital, the city and the country in the time we have left!
