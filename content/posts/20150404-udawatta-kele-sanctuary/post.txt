The map of the trails left something to be desired, but we still stumbled upon a tribe of around 20-30 monkeys playing. A monk came by as we watched and seemed amused at our excitement, noting that they are “everywhere” and that many creatures can be seen in these woods if we approach quietly. He spoke superb english and also gave us the handy warning that there are many leaches in the area but they are really quite harmless.
