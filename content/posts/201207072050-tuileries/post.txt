Saturday I slept in.  I then intended to go the the Louvre, but as I was drinking a coffee outside I met an Arabic decorative painter outside who was looking for Jardin des Tuileries and he convinced me to join him. His french (2nd language) was better than his english which was far better than my french... but that actually worked out well for someone for me to endeavor to speak with.  When it started raining we ducked into this AHAE photography exhibit.  It was cliche material, but it was done well so still very enjoyable.

In the evening, Caitlin and Zia and I had a picnic on the Seine with some wine and champagne and then went to a Caitlin's favorite bar for some dancing. Glad to get a taste for the night life and glad to have done so with friends.
