Text: <p>Took us a while to pick a place to eat, but when we finally made a selection it was a good one: Bistro tang. Diana’s stomach had been a bit upset and the Yin Oi Tong Herbal Chicken Noodle Soup that “restores the balance of chi in the body” seemed to be just the thing. Grin had a scruptions Nyonya chicken curry and we split the pictured dessert.</p>
