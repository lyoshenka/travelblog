Ate breakfast in Clockwise cafe in Penang. Grin immediately identified our waitress as Ukrainian and she seemed pleased for the chance to speak her native language. Diana had mango pancakes, Grin had a salmon omelet and pue reh tea. Then we took a longer than expected bus ride back to KL and so scraped our plans to visit the Batu Caves but we were instead able to check out the Lake Gardens before dinner.

Atmosphere 360 - the rotating restaurant on top of the Menara KL tower - turned out to be to expensive for our tastes. But the view was still nice even on a cloudy day! We ended up getting delicious Thai food nearby.
