Wandering around Abu Dhabi turned out to be an odd plan as the city is really built for cars. But the buses were easy to figure out and we had a good lunch at a Nepali restaurant and enjoyed walking down The Corniche walkway (near the beach). Eventually we sought A/C and wifi at a shopping center. Grabbed some yummy shwarma-like sandwitches and an amazing kiwi smoothie on our way back to the airport.

We were overall pleased with Etihad airways - though the onboard prayers were a bit creapy!: “In the Name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. All praise be to Ahhah, the One who has placed this transportation at our service, <strong>that we ourselves would not have been capable of, and to Allah we shall return.</strong> In the name of Allah, we begin to move (take-off) and stop (land). With His protection, Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.”
