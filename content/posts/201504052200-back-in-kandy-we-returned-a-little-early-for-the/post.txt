Text: We returned a little early for the traditional dance and fire walking at Oak Ray so we stopped for a tour of a jewelry store including a video on how the gems are dug out of deep holes in the earth and also a tour of a woodcarving shop. Then we caught a bus back to Colombo as there were no trains (despite what the schedule said).
