Text: It was a challenge to find the Lorong baru hawker stands which were just off our map. When we got there ee ate a million things: satay, chee cheong fun, seafood char koay kak, curry mee, ais kacang, more crepe cake. We walked home to Guest Inn Muntri through love lane past lots of hipster coffee shops and a shop that let us send postcards into the future.
