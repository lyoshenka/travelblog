Text: The most surprising thing I learned is that it wasn't until after the revolution that doctors worked in hospitals. A hospital (derivation: hospitality) was just a place for the sick and the homeless to go when they had nowhere else to turn. There were no treatments even attempted, and really disease just spread there. After the revolution, religion had less power and it was not as sacrilegious to dissect the dead. So doctors finally went to hospitals out of scientific interest.
