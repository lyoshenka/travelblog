On Thursday we went to Hôpital Paul Brousse and talked to one of the doctors about her addiction clinic. It was helpful that the doctor was bilingual and was able to express in depth views on her hospital, training and programs in English. In addition to standard therapies, patients can participate in cooking their meals, they have exercise rooms and art rooms and even massage therapy and hypnosis. The doctor talked about the importance for addicts to reconnect with their bodies and everything they are capable off. It sounded pretty enlightened and I don't think we have anything to compare in the US. The doctor was also unique, within the France system as well, for being dual trained in addiction and in psychiatry. This allows her to provide comprehensive care since these conditions are so often co-morbid.  

On Friday, we went to Hôpital Tenon.  The central part is the chapel of the hospital, which was lovely.  There has been a modern expansion of the hospital and the new entrance is depicted in the second image.
