This is where Diana will be working! There are ~50 male patients on one ward and ~50 females on another, all cared for by one attending or “madame.” That’s what they all call her but when I picked it up one of the “registrars” (residents) shook his head and said “it’s a strange tradition that we call her that much less you.”

The walk home is ~1/2hr so I’ll probably usually take a tuk tuk (once I learn how to tell them where to take me). But most of the walk is through Viharamahadevi Park which is really quite lovely.
