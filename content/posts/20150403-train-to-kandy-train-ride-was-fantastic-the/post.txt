Text: Train ride was fantastic. The scenery was beautiful and we got to stick our heads far out the window and feel the breeze the whole way there. The people on the train were friendly, and the kids loved us. Stayed at a lovely Blue Haven guesthouse outside the city where we saw this crow amid the mist. Asked if a plant was papaya - turns out it’s “king coconut.”
