Text: We wanted to spend the night at <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/sri-lanka/the-hill-country/kandy/hotels/burmese-rest">Burmese Rest</a>, a super-cheap super-basic hostel run by monks, but our tour guide convinced us to go to the Blue Haven guesthouse. It turned out to be a great choice. The guesthouse is nestled in a quiet valley outside the city. There were tons of birds in the morning amid the mist and king coconut growing right outside our window.
