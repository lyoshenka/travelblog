Text: We decided to walk to dinner from the train station to take in the city. It was pretty dark at this point, but the walk along the lake was nice. After the walk, we hiked a small hill to get to [Helga’s Folly](http://www.helgasfolly.com) - a hotel/restaurant inspired by Dali’s art. The lights were dim, walls were covered in paintings and murals, and the whole place had a somewhat dreamlike quality to it. The food sucked, but we didn’t let that ruin the experience for us.
