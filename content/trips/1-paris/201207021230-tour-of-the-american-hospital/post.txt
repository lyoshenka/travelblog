The American hospital had a limited set of services including very low trauma capabilities, but it had more diagnostic imaging and seemed very quite and comfortable. Apperently it is "tres chic" to be treated there. The took us out for a nice lunch. The picture of the tub isn't great but I had to document that they offer water birth. The sanitation is expensive and it is only used in the early stages of labor, but still it's neat.

This was after our first 2-hour session learning medical french - we'll have these all week.  My french is pretty terrible and I miss a lot of what's happening, but no doubt it will help.
