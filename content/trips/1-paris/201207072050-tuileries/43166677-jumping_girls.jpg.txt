Caption: A bunch of women doing i'm-really-not-sure-what in a courtyard of Palais Royal. Maybe it was a bachlorette party, but there were a lot of other people standing around watching them repeatedly try to jump in unison. Maybe it had something to do with Comédie Française, the national theater next door.
