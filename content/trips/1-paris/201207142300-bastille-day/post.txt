On the 13th the was a huge parade before the holiday.
On bastille day itself I wandered around the curve stone roads of Montmartre and saw Sacre-Coeur. A nice guy saw me staring at my guidebook and showed me around for a little while eventually asking me if wanted a boyfriend, but was courteous enough when I told him I already had one. Watched the sun set over the city before heading to a crowded hot-spot for watching the fireworks.
