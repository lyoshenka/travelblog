Text: We actually had gotten engaged the evening before (on the 12th). After buying the ring together earlier in the day we talked it over in the bathtub later that night and decided we were ready! The next morning we broke the news to Ivan and Marina. Marina was kind enough to do a quick photoshoot on the beach for us before we had to head to the airport.
