Victoria Park had gorgeous English style flower gardens and also lots of open space. We threw a frisbee for a bit and then some Sri Lankans joined in. After security told us we had to stop we gave the disc away to man who was particularly inquisitive about it.

We were the only people staying at Blue Haven and the mistress of the place made us a wonderful rice and curry dinner plus some to go breakfast packs for our early start the next day.
