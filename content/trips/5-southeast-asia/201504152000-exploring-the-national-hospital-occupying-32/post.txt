Occupying 32 acre blocks it’s not really a single place… Early on a tuk tuk brought me to an unfamiliar entrance and I made him drive around for quite some time looking for something I recognized. I recently learned that the number on the chart (or “Bed head ticket”) refers what number admission it is for the year… it’s in the 62,000s in 3.5 months!

Earlier today the registrars took me with them to a buddhist temple within the complex. A monk dipped leaves into oil and brushed it over each of our heads to bring us good fortune in the new year. Then we ate tasty (coconut) milk rice and tea.
