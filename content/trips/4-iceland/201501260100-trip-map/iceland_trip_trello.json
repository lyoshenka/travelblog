Their menu also includes other traditional Icelandic food.\n\n- Skyr, the local yoghurt (debates still rage about whether it IS actually a yoghurt) comes in many flavours and can be bought from any supermarket in individual portions.\n\n- Very fresh fish - Icelandic Fish & Chips, Tryggvagötu 8, 101 Reykjavík\n\n- Gamla Vínhúsið at Klapparstíg 38 in Reykjavík serves delicious Mink Whale\n\n- There is one desert Gamla is famous for too which was described to me as like Yogurt but not yogurt.
