Fed some horses we passed on the road as we set out driving along the south cost.
First waterfall: Seljalandsfoss.
On the road passed by a farm at the foot of Eyjafjallajökull a glacier topped active volcano.
Second waterfall: Skógafoss. The weather at the top was pretty brutal!
Then  Skógar folk museum with great displays and huts recreating life in Iceland over the centuries.
Hung out at Reynisfjara black beach with basalt columns as the sun set
Ate a scrumptious dinner in Kirkjubæjarklaustur village
Made it to our accommodations at Hörgsland Cottages
