Text: Next we headed for Þingvellir (anglicized as Thingvellir), a unique location both geologically and in Iceland's history (the oldest existing parliament in the world first assembled there in 930 AD). We first stopped at lake Þingvallavatn just to the south. Almost got wet adding to my coin collection. Saw a wild sheep! Afterward we drove back to Reykjavik and ate some yummy Fish n' Chips.
