Ate a snack in the early morning hours after chasing the Aurora Borealis, a little sleepy despite the excitement. Then set out to see a few more of Iceland's natural wonders. Relaxed at a thermal bath at Fontana spa (ok that's a stock photo, none of us brought cameras in, but the natural clear hot waters were luxurious). As the sun set, made it to Lax-รก Geysir Cottages, a few structures doting an otherwise vast empty terrain.
